For my first assignment I will create a guessing game variation.  Instead of me asking the computer the number, the computer will ask a series of yes or no question to quickly narrow down your number.

Hopefully and improvement to avoid people choosing the furthest possible option from the question, the narrowing questions will be asked randomly
